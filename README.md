# Development
**Steps to enable/setup live chat** 

#### Step 1
**`Setup Wizard`** - Here we need to setup **Admin info, Organization Info, Server Info, and Register Server**.

#### Step 2
Click on a Left side-Top **3 dot icon** and select **`Administration`**.

#### Step 3
Now click on **Users** at the left sidebar and add a new user with the role **`Livechat Agent`**.

#### Step 4
Now click on **Omnichannel** at the left sidebar. Here we need to enable a switch in the **`Omnichannel enabled`** section. We can do the necessary setup of **Livechat** like ***Livechat Title and etc*** in the **Livechat section**. We can also **`change other settings`** like ***Guest Counter, Omnichannel Room Count*** as per requirements in the **same panel**. **`After all changes`**, we need to **click** on the **Save button** at the top right to **`save settings`**.

#### Step 5
Click on a Left side-Top **3 dot icon** and select **`Omnichannel`** and go to the **`Livechat Appearance`**. Here we can change **Show agent information** with an option like ***Name, Nickname, and None***. We can also change **other settings for Livechat Appearance** here. **`After all changes`**, we need to **click** on the **Save button** at the top right to **`save settings`**.

#### Step 6
Now open the **`project URL`** in a **new browser** so we can log in as an **`Agent`**. Here agent needs to **enable** the **`Omnichannel`** setting which means he/she is **available for a chat**.

#### Step 7
Now open the **`projectURL/livechat`(https://example.com/livechat)** in another **new browser** so we can test live chat as **`Guest`**. We can **start a chat** as a **`guest`** by ***adding a name and email***. When **`guests or any other users start chat`** agent will **get a notification** and a **chat button** in the left sidebar. **`The agent`** can **give a reply** by click on that button. **`The agent`** can **close the chat** by click on the left sidebar button and **`the user`** can **close the chat** by click on ***`option->Finish This Chat`*** button.

#### Step 8
**`During chat`** by following **step 5** we can change **`"Show agent information"`** with an option like ***Name, Nickname, and None***. Need to **reload live chat URL** to see updates.
